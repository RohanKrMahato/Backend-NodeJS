### The Promise `object` represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

## A Promise is in one of these states:
    - pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
    - fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
    - rejected: meaning that the operation failed.


## NOTE: `await` pause the execution of the function at the point where `await` is called untill the Promise gets resolve or rejected
